As discussed, I’ve exported the complete list of modules from our internal Python library ent_pycore. This should help us during design and implementation of the circuit breaker for our top-priority LLM use case.

Please find the attached/exported list for your reference. I recommend reviewing it so we can align on which functions to leverage as part of the circuit breaker logic, and avoid duplicating efforts.

"Hey team! Just to give a quick update: I'm currently designing a circuit breaker for our supervisor code to handle our top-priority LLM use case. I've identified the key use cases we need to cover and mapped out how we can leverage our internal ent_pycore library functions for that. I'm finalizing the code design based on those internal libraries, and I’ve exported a list of all the relevant functions to share with you all. So right now, I'm in the middle of coding it out and should have something concrete soon. Thanks!"

Improved Prompt (Zero-Shot Instruction)

Role: You are a senior software engineer in a high-performing team. Think like a Google engineer or someone at a billion-dollar startup.

Task: I will provide a priority LLM use case where we need to design and implement a circuit breaker to protect user workflows.

What you must do:

Analyze the Use Case: Identify reliability risks, failure modes, and user impact.

Propose Circuit Breaker Design: State model (Closed/Open/Half-open), thresholds, recovery policy, fallbacks, and observability.

Justify with STAR Reasoning: Explain Situation, Task, Actions, and Results (expected impact on SLOs).

Draft Standup Communication: A concise 2–3 sentence update I can say in the standup to my team/managers. Must sound professional, outcome-focused, and impactful.

Output Format:

Section 1: Use Case Analysis

Section 2: Circuit Breaker Design

Section 3: STAR Rationale

Section 4: Standup Update (short, ready-to-say)

Constraints:

Keep the design production-grade and reviewable.

Frame everything in terms of reliability, scalability, and user impact.

Standup update should be concise, clear, and highlight business value.
