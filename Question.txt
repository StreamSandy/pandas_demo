Perfect — these are exactly the kind of probing, architect-level validation questions that a Senior GenAI Solutions Architect at Goldman Sachs should ask during an ideation or review session.

Below is a refined and structured list you can use during the discussion or in written feedback.
Each question is grouped by intent, with examples of why to ask and what insight you’re seeking.

⸻

🧩 1. Problem Understanding & Current State

(Purpose: Clarify the baseline and pain points before jumping to AI solutions.)
	•	How is this activity currently being handled manually?
→ Helps identify which steps are repetitive, error-prone, or inconsistent.
	•	What tools or logs are used today (e.g., DBA tables, Splunk, Informatica lineage)?
→ Reveals available data sources for automation.
	•	What specific challenges or delays are teams facing during decommissioning?
→ Quantifies effort, risk, and ROI opportunities.
	•	What is the current approval and audit trail process before dropping tables?
→ Important for defining automation safety checks.

⚙️ 2. Solution Design & Alternative Approaches

(Purpose: Assess if GenAI is the best fit or if simpler automation suffices.)
	•	Is there a simpler rule-based or SQL-script automation that can achieve 70–80 % of the outcome?
→ Tests whether GenAI adds unique value.
	•	Can we schedule scripts to analyze table access patterns and generate cleanup reports without AI?
→ Evaluates whether this should start as a conventional automation.
	•	If GenAI is used, what part of the process actually needs reasoning or summarization (vs. deterministic logic)?
→ Differentiates between automation and intelligence use cases.
	•	Could we integrate existing data-catalog or lineage tools (Informatica EDC, Collibra) before building a new AI layer?
→ Encourages reuse of enterprise assets.

🧠 3. Nature of the Use Case

(Purpose: Position it correctly within the innovation funnel.)
	•	Is this still in ideation stage or have we validated feasibility with real metadata samples?
→ Determines maturity (ideation → prototype → production).
	•	Does the proposed approach rely on GenAI (language-based reasoning) or traditional AI/ML (pattern detection)?
→ Clarifies model category and infrastructure needs.
	•	What is the expected output format — plain reports, recommendations, or executable scripts?
→ Defines scope and success criteria.

⸻

🚀 4. Scalability & Implementation

(Purpose: Check readiness for enterprise scale and operationalization.)
	•	How would this scale across 1000+ schemas and multiple data platforms (Oracle, Snowflake, DB2)?
→ Surfaces integration complexity.
	•	Can the AI reasoning handle cross-system dependencies (e.g., ETL jobs, API feeds)?
→ Tests robustness of dependency detection.
	•	What automation hooks are planned — ServiceNow tickets, Confluence reports, or Git-based workflows?
→ Connects insights to action.
	•	What safety nets are built in (dry-run mode, approval gating, rollback)?
→ Ensures compliance and resilience.

⸻

💡 5. Business Value & Organizational Impact

(Purpose: Quantify why the organization should care.)
	•	What measurable benefits do we expect — storage savings, fewer DBA hours, compliance risk reduction?
→ Converts innovation to business KPIs.
	•	How will this align with broader modernization or data-governance initiatives?
→ Links to strategic programs.
	•	Who are the primary beneficiaries — DBAs, data-governance team, or application owners?
→ Clarifies stakeholder value.
	•	Can we estimate ROI or efficiency gain from the proposed automation?
→ Supports prioritization in the GenAI portfolio.

⸻

🧭 6. Risk & Governance

(Purpose: Ensure the solution aligns with regulatory and internal risk controls.)
	•	How will we prevent false positives — i.e., AI recommending deletion of active but infrequent tables?
→ Drives requirement for human-in-loop validation.
	•	What audit trail or explainability will accompany each recommendation?
→ Essential for regulatory compliance and trust.
	•	Does this access or process any sensitive metadata requiring data-classification review?
→ Ensures security compliance.

⸻

🏁 7. Decision Framing Questions

(Purpose: Conclude discussion with actionable next steps.)
	•	Should this move forward as a quick automation PoC first, or as a GenAI pilot with explainable reasoning?
	•	If successful, how will we integrate it into ongoing decommissioning workflows?
	•	Who will own the model maintenance and metadata refresh process?

⸻

✅ How to Use These Questions
	•	In a design review meeting: Ask 1–2 from each category to guide the discussion logically.
	•	In written feedback (email or Confluence): Group them under Feasibility • Alternatives • Impact • Risks.
	•	During ideation boards: Mark questions that uncover automation readiness vs GenAI necessity.

Would you like me to turn these into a review checklist template (Markdown + rating columns for Feasibility, Value, Risk, Next Steps) that you can reuse for validating other GenAI use cases across engineering teams?
